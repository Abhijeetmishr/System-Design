## PAYMENT GATEWAY PROCESSOR
### Requirements

#### Transaction Management
Users can create a transaction with:

    - transaction_id (unique)
    - amount 
    - currency (e.g., INR, USD)
    - payment_method (e.g., CARD, UPI, WALLET)
    - Initial status: INITIATED

Transaction status can change to:

    - PROCESSING
    - SUCCESS
    - FAILED

#### Payment Methods (Pluggable)
The system must support multiple payment methods:
    
    CARD â†’ simulate OTP verification step.
    UPI â†’ simulate UPI collect request.
    WALLET â†’ simulate wallet balance check.

Each payment method has its own processing strategy.

âœ… Use Strategy Pattern to support extensibility.

### Idempotency

If a client retries the same transaction request (same transaction_id), the system should return the existing transaction status instead of creating a duplicate.

### Thread-Safety

Multiple users can make payment requests concurrently.

Ensure concurrency-safe in-memory storage (using mutex or sync.Map).

### Query Operations

Fetch a transaction by transaction_id.

List all transactions by status (INITIATED, PROCESSING, SUCCESS, FAILED).

Get statistics:

Total transactions

Successful transactions

Failed transactions

### Bonus (Observer Pattern)

Send a notification (log to console) when a transaction reaches SUCCESS or FAILED.

Example:

Notification: Transaction TXN123 SUCCESS for INR 1000 via UPI

CREATE_TRANSACTION

CREATE_TRANSACTION,<transaction_id>,<amount>,<currency>,<payment_method>


Output:

TRANSACTION_CREATED <transaction_id>


or

Error: Duplicate transaction


PROCESS_TRANSACTION

PROCESS_TRANSACTION,<transaction_id>


Output:

TRANSACTION_SUCCESS <transaction_id>


or

TRANSACTION_FAILED <transaction_id>


or

Error: Transaction not found


GET_TRANSACTION

GET_TRANSACTION,<transaction_id>


Output:

<transaction_id>,<amount>,<currency>,<payment_method>,<status>


LIST_TRANSACTIONS

LIST_TRANSACTIONS,<status>


Output:

<txn_id>,<txn_id>,<txn_id>...

Sample Test Case

Input

    CREATE_TRANSACTION,TXN1,1000,INR,UPI
    CREATE_TRANSACTION,TXN2,2000,INR,CARD
    PROCESS_TRANSACTION,TXN1
    PROCESS_TRANSACTION,TXN2
    GET_TRANSACTION,TXN1
    LIST_TRANSACTIONS,SUCCESS
    GET_STATISTICS

Output

    TRANSACTION_CREATED TXN1
    TRANSACTION_CREATED TXN2
    TRANSACTION_SUCCESS TXN1
    TRANSACTION_FAILED TXN2
    TXN1,1000,INR,UPI,SUCCESS
    TXN1
    TOTAL:2,SUCCESS:1,FAILED:1


### Requirement Gathering
1. create transaction with amount and unique transaction_id
2. consider diffrent transaction methods like wallet, UPI, CARD
3. fetch transaction by id 
4. List all transaction by status 
5. GET statistics like failed, successful, processing

### API
1. CREATE(transaction_id, amount, currency_type, payment_type)
2. PROCESS_TRANSACTION(TXN_ID)
3. GET_TRANSACTION_BY_ID(transaction_id)
4. GET_ALL_TRANSACTION_BY_STATUS(status)
5. GET STATS()
